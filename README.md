# TournamentPredictor
Tournament Predictor made for ECE 586, using VHDL

ABSTRACT
Branch prediction plays a crucial role in overcoming control hazards and improving the
performance of processors by exposing instruction-level parallelism. This paper explores the concept of
branch prediction and its significance in minimizing pipeline stalls. It discusses various branch prediction
schemes, including static and dynamic predictors, and focuses on the implementation of a tournament
predictor using VHDL or Verilog. The tournament predictor combines a global predictor and a local
predictor with a selector to make correct predictions based on branch history. The paper also addresses
the challenges faced during the implementation process, such as the inability to read input from a text
file and proposes future work to enhance the tournament predictor's functionality. Additionally, it
suggests the use of output files to generate Python functions for calculating precise accuracy
percentages. The conclusion emphasizes the need for further development to maximize the practical
utility of the tournament predictor and its potential expansion to manage a larger number of branches.
